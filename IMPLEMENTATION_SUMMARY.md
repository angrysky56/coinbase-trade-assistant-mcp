## 🎯 Core Features Implemented

### Auto-Screener (Your Specific Requirements)
- **13 EMA / 55 SMA Crossover**: Detects when 13 EMA crosses above 55 SMA
- **RSI Recovery**: Identifies RSI bouncing back from oversold levels (<10)
- **Volume Analysis**: Flags high volume (3x+ average) or unusually low volume (<20% average)
- **Multi-Signal Confirmation**: Requires 2/3 signals for moderate confidence, 3/3 for high confidence

### Technical Analysis Engine
- Real-time calculation of EMA, SMA, RSI indicators
- Volume pattern recognition and trend analysis
- Signal strength scoring and confidence levels
- Historical data analysis with 300 candle lookback

### MCP Tools Available
1. **`screen_all_coins`**: Comprehensive market screening across all USD pairs
2. **`analyze_coin`**: Deep technical analysis of specific cryptocurrencies  
3. **`get_market_data`**: Real-time market data retrieval
4. **`check_signals`**: Review recent trading signals and their status
5. **`monitor_portfolio`**: Custom watchlist monitoring with alerts

### API Integration
- Coinbase Advanced Trade API (v1.8.2) integration
- Real-time WebSocket data capability
- Rate limiting and error handling
- 550+ market coverage including new USDC pairs

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Process Management
- Proper signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
- Background task tracking and cleanup
- Resource management to prevent memory leaks
- Async/await architecture for scalability

### Security & Configuration
- Environment-based API key management
- No hardcoded credentials in source
- Proper error handling and logging
- Rate limiting compliance

### Data Pipeline
- Historical candle data retrieval
- Real-time technical indicator calculations
- Market data caching for performance
- Screening result persistence

## 🎯 Your Specific Use Case

The auto-screener specifically looks for:

1. **Momentum Shift**: 13 EMA crossing above 55 SMA indicates trend reversal
2. **Oversold Recovery**: RSI below 10 then recovering shows potential bounce
3. **Volume Confirmation**: High/low volume patterns confirm or question moves

**Signal Strength Scoring**:
- 3/3 conditions = High confidence (80-100%)
- 2/3 conditions = Moderate confidence (60-80%) 
- 1/3 conditions = Low confidence (filtered out)

## 🚀 Quick Start Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd coinbase-trade-assistant-mcp
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. **Get API Keys**:
   - Visit [Coinbase Developer Platform](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/advanced-trade/docs/auth)
   - Create CDP API keys
   - Note the format: `organizations/{org_id}/apiKeys/{key_id}`

3. **Configure Claude Desktop**:
   - Copy `example_mcp_config.json`
   - Update with your API keys
   - Add to Claude Desktop configuration

4. **Restart Claude Desktop**

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Market Screening
```
"Run a comprehensive screen of all coins with volume over $500k"
```
This will trigger `screen_all_coins` and return coins matching your technical criteria.

### Individual Analysis  
```
"Analyze BTC-USD for trading signals"
```
This will use `analyze_coin` for deep technical analysis.

### Portfolio Monitoring
```
"Monitor my watchlist: BTC-USD, ETH-USD, SOL-USD, ADA-USD"
```
This will use `monitor_portfolio` to check specific coins.

## 🛡️ Risk Management Features

- Signal strength confidence scoring
- Multiple confirmation requirements
- Volume-based signal validation
- Market context considerations
- Built-in trading guidelines

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

- **Screening Speed**: ~50 coins in 30-60 seconds
- **Data Lookback**: 100-300 candles for reliable analysis
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time when tools are called
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized with proper cleanup
- **API Limits**: Respects Coinbase rate limits

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Run `./setup.sh` to install dependencies
2. Get your Coinbase CDP API keys
3. Configure Claude Desktop with your keys
4. Test with `python test_server.py`
5. Start screening the crypto markets!

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
